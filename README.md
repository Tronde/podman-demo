# A repository for Podman demos and workshops

In this repository my Podman demos and workshops are developed and maintained.
There is a branch for each demo/workshop with a README.md in it providing information on scope and requirements.

From time to time I create (pre-)releases from the workshop branches for convenience.

Feel free to explore and use these workshops and let me know whether you like them.
