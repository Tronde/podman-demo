  <DT><A HREF="http://funky16corners.com" description="The best in funk, soul, jazz and rare groove vinyl
I have been writing about music in various forms (zines, newspapers, e-zines, blogs) since the mid-80â€™s. The Funky16Corners blog started in November of 2004 to focus on funk and soul vinyl. Since mid-2006, in addition to individual MP3 tracks, I have been posting mixes under the title Funky16Corners radio. Most MP3s and mixes will be available for a few weeks."  hash="c6a22bb8833fd19fe724bd1c5cbd42df" TAGS="funk,musik,blog" ADD_DATE="1491107880" >Funky16Corners</a>
