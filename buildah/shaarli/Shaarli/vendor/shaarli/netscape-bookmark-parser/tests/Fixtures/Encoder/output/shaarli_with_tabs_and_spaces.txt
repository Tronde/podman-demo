I will write some formating using spaces:

  * For example,
  * lists,
    + but also
    + sublists
  * use spaces.

Also code:

```
foreach ($data['linksToDisplay'] as $key => $bookmark) {
    $length = strlen($bookmark['title']) + (342 * strlen($bookmark['description'])) / 836;
    if (! empty($bookmark['thumbnail'])) {
		$length += 100; // 1 thumbnails roughly takes 100 pixels height.
    }
}
```
