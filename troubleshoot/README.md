Lab: Troubleshooting
====================

  * Run the script `fix-mytinytodo.sh` to setup the lab
  * Diagnose and fix all issues in the script

While you can just read the script, compare it to the man pages and fix it, I recommend using the following commands to diagnose the issues.

  * podman-container-inspect(1)
  * podman-events(1)
  * podman-image-inspect(1)
  * podman-network-inspect(1)
  * podman-volume-inspect(1)

In case you cannot find all issues, take a look into solution-fix-mytinytodo.md
